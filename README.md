# Dev Today

[![Latest release](https://gitnote.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/tsconfig.png)](https://dev-today.adam-gordon.info)

## üåê Demo

Here is a working live demo: <https://adam-gordon.dev/posts>

## üìù Description

DevToday is a content creation platform for developers. It offers a feed of dev news, podcasts, and events, keeping you up-to-date with the latest tech. It has interactive features like podcast audio playback, meetup maps, and more. You can think of it as the go-to developer community hub.

- Motivation: To test my skills and put together a user friendly, developer focused social media site.
- Why I Built This Project: A lot of "developer" social media is scattered; I wanted to centralize it.
- Problem Solved: Developers can arrange to meetup, record podcasts/audio to share informaation across multiple modes of communication, or just post.
- What I Learned: With a business-like attitude and a good team (even a small one), when collaborating while staying humble, open to feedback, and accountable, it's possible to build a comprehensive site with complex features (e.g., a site-wide audio player that persists across navigation, a separate `socket.io` service for instant updates, live communication, and notifications). Designing mobile-first simplifies scaling to larger screens. Framer Motion works best as a progressive enhancement on a solid layout; fundamentals like color palette, spacing, and consistent UX patterns make or break quality. I also refined skills using a modern TypeScript-friendly ORM, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, and `zod` for typed validation. Thoughtful layout techniques (relative/absolute positioning plus modern flex utilities) help scale images while preserving intent.

## ‚ôø Accessibility

This project includes an ongoing accessibility (a11y) initiative to meet WCAG 2.1 AA where practical.

Key Improvements Implemented:

- Landmarks: Single `<main id="main-content">`, semantic `<header>` / `<nav>` separation, skip link for keyboard users.
- Keyboard Navigation: All interactive icons converted to `<button>` or given proper roles; consistent focus styles via utilities.
- Forms: Inputs now have explicit `id`/`htmlFor` links; validation messages use `role="alert"` + `aria-describedby`.
- Dialogs & Menus: Radix primitives leveraged; added labeling (`aria-label`, listbox semantics for group selector, notification menu labeling).
- Live Regions: Toast notifications wrapped in `aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true"` region.
- Media: Meaningful `alt` text for logos and content images; decorative icons marked `aria-hidden` by default.
- Tags & Status: Tags rendered as semantic lists; status indicators (icons) can expose text alternatives when `decorative={false}`.
- Color & Focus: Introduced reusable focus ring utilities; future contrast audits guided by design tokens.

Utilities (Tailwind layer):

- `.focus-ring` ‚Äì Adds accessible focus outline (`ring-2` + offset) for keyboard users.
- `.focus-inset-ring` ‚Äì Variant without offset for tighter components.
- `.sr-only` ‚Äì Hides text visually while keeping it for assistive tech.
- `.icon-button` ‚Äì Consistent styling (hover, focus) for small icon-only buttons.

Usage Examples:

```tsx
<button className="icon-button" aria-label="Open search">‚Ä¶</button>
<div className="focus-ring" role="button" tabIndex={0}>Custom Control</div>
<span className="sr-only">Online</span>
```

Authoring Guidelines:

1. Always provide an accessible name (visible text or `aria-label`).
2. Associate errors with fields using `aria-describedby`.
3. Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA; add ARIA only when semantics are insufficient.
4. Ensure newly added interactive elements include a visible or programmatic focus indicator.
5. Avoid relying solely on color to convey state (include text or icon shape changes).

Planned / Next Steps:

- Contrast token verification and adjustments.
- Add jest-axe for automated component accessibility regression tests.
- Reduced motion handling for animated transitions.
- Extend focus utilities to any newly added components.

If you spot an accessibility issue, please open an issue with the label `a11y`.
